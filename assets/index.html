                <p>
                    At JP Morgan Chase, I currently work on building systems for
                    merchants, focusing on enhancing payment processing, transaction
                    security, and overall operational efficiency. My role involves
                    developing scalable, secure, and user-friendly solutions that
                    empower merchants to better manage payments, streamline
                    transactions, and improve customer experiences. By leveraging
                    cutting-edge technology, I contribute to the creation of innovative
                    tools that drive growth and operational excellence for merchant
                    partners.

                    multiple clients, contributing to the development and enhancement of
                    systems and user experiences across various industries. My work
                    involved leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex
                    business challenges, optimize workflows, and improve user
                    satisfaction. Some of the key clients and projects I contributed to
                    include:

                        At BP, I worked on developing AI-driven applications designed to
                        improve operations and enhance contractor handling. This included
                        building intelligent systems that optimized workflows and
                        streamlined contractor interactions for greater efficiency.
                        Additionally, I contributed to the development of a suite of
                        Product Management tools that leverage AI to standardize
                        processes, improve decision-making, and elevate the overall PM
                        experience. These tools were aimed at simplifying complex tasks,
                        increasing productivity, and fostering better collaboration across
                        teams.
